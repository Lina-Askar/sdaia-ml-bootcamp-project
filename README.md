# SDAIA ML Bootcamp – Assessment Project

This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Bootcamp organized by SDAIA. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python and common ML libraries.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature selection
- Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN)
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix
- Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Run each cell step-by-step
3. Review outputs and model performance metrics

## Notes
This project was developed as part of the final assessment in the SDAIA ML Bootcamp (April–May 2024).
